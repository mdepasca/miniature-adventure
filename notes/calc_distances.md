Calculating distances
======================

- To get the distance between 2 lightcurves is **easy**: R function `dist()`
  does excactly this

  > Description:

    > This function computes and returns the distance matrix computed by
    > using the specified distance measure to compute the distances
    > between the rows of a data matrix.
